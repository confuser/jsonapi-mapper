## Setup for development

As easy as it gets:

* Have `git`, `node`, and `npm` ready
* Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:scoutforpets/jsonapi-mapper`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`. This will also run the `prepublish` script running TypeScript-specific tasks
* Profit!

## Running tests

Just run `npm test`. The tests are also in TypeScript made under the Jasmine framework.
